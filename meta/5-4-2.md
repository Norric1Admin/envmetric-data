indicator_definition: Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific
  development agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates
  of poverty consistent with the country’s specific economic and social circumstances,
  and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.

  Data is based on calendar year of site designation.  For 2019, the data cut-off is 31 May. The boundary between protected areas on-land and at-sea is mean high water (mean high water spring in Scotland).  Coastal sites in the indicator are split between ‘on-land’ and ‘at-sea’ if they
  cross the mean high water mark.  At-sea extent includes offshore marine protected areas out to the limit of the UK continental shelf. Extent is based on the following site designations - Areas of Special Scientific Interest, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, National Nature Reserves,
  Marine Conservation Zones, Nature Conservation Marine Protected Areas, Ramsar Sites, Special Areas of Conservation (including candidate Special Areas of Conservation and Sites of Community Importance), Special Protection Areas, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Scenic Areas,
  National Parks. Many protected areas in the UK cover the same physical parcels of land, but for different reasons; as a result the designation types can overlap.  For example, it is possible for an individual site to be designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Special
  Area of Conservation (SAC), Special Protection Area (SPA), Ramsar site and National Nature Reserve (NNR), and could also be part of a National Park, an AONB (Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty) or National Scenic Area (NSA).
computation_calculations: >-
  Total extent of protected areas at-sea is calculated using a program written by JNCC which uses a number of site designation files as input, and calculates a set of non-overlapping polygons for that entire set of designations for each year.  This has allowed the basis of the indicator to
  be expanded over time (including more site types), and allows comparisons to be made between inclusion and exclusion of wider landscape designations. The program also splits the areas calculated into terrestrial, inshore (within 12 nautical miles of the coast), and offshore (beyond 12NM
  out to the edge of the UK Continental shelf).  Inshore and offshore extent are combined in the measure ‘Total extent of protected areas at-sea’. It is recognised that the denominator for this indicator is different to that of SDG 14.2.1 (Proportion of national exclusive economic zones
  managed using ecosystem-based approaches), however the wider definition (including the areas of continental shelf that the UK is responsible for) was appropriate to this indicator as well as SDG 14.2.1

On the 25 July 1997, the UK ratified the [agreements](https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/status2018.pdf) from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. On the same day, it ratified the agreement on the implementation of Part XI of the Convention (the implementation agreement).

In 1998, The Council for the European Union [committed](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31998D0392&from=EN) European Union member states to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI. The UK has transferred certain matters governed by the convention to the EU e.g. conservation and management of sea fishing resources. Further legislation and conventions that the UK government have signed up to have come into force and some of these examples are  - 

[Industrial Emissions Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2010/75/oj),

[Directive on Ship- Source Pollution](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1574248687164&uri=CELEX:32005L0035)

The UK is also a member of [OSPAR](https://www.ospar.org/about), a mechanism by which 15 Governments and the EU cooperate to protect the marine environment in the North East Atlantic.
