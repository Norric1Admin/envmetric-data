indicator_definition: Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the country’s specific economic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.

  The Green Cover Index is meant to measure the changes of the green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, crop land, etc. – in order to monitor progress on the mountain target. The index will provide information on the changes in the vegetation cover and, as such, will provide an indication of the status of the conservation of mountain environments. Woodland certification assesses management practices against agreed environmental standards. Certification requires that wood products are harvested legally and sustainably, and that important wildlife habitats are identified and are not negatively impacted by management.
computation_calculations: (Area of woodland / Area of land mass ) * 100 OR (Area of certified woodland / Area of land mass ) * 100. Growth rates (%) are calculated by ((Area certified OR Total woodland Area in year n - Area certified OR Total woodland Area in year n-1) / Area certified OR Total woodland Area in year n-1) * 100
