  The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameters (PM2.5) is a common measure of air pollution. The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [Î¼g/m3 ]. Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases. Urban/rural data - while the data quality available for urban/rural population is generally good for high income countries, it can be relatively poor for some low- and middle income areas. Furthermore, the definition of urban/rural may greatly vary by country.
computation_calculations: The annual urban mean concentration of PM2.5 is estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016a; Shaddick et al, 2016).
