indicator_definition: Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific
  development agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates
  of poverty consistent with the country’s specific economic and social circumstances,
  and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.

  UK’s material footprint, or raw material consumption, captures the amount of domestic and foreign extraction of materials needed to produce the products used by households, governments and charities in the UK.
  <p>Material Footprint estimates provided are based on a <a href=
  "https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1798247/6874172/Handbook-country-RME-tool/">Eurostat method</a> and calculated as raw material equivalent of imports (RMEIM) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material equivalents of exports (RMEEX). </p>
  <p>Material footprint per GDP is calculated as raw material consumption (material footprint)/GDP.</p>
  <p>Material footprint per
  capita is calculated as raw material consumption (material footprint)/UK population.</p>
  Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials. DMC per capita is calculated as DMC/UK population. DMC per GDP is calculated as DMC/GDP.
computation_calculations: <p>No calculations were performed in the data acquisition for DMC and DMC per capita as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.</p><p>Domestic Material per GDP is calculated as DMC/GDP.</p>
data_footnote: >-
  1. Imports and exports for 'Other' and 'waste for final treatment and disposal' are included in the Domestic Material Consumption estimates.
  2. Total material input and consumption for 2016 onwards may be slight underestimates due to small missing data sources on extraction for some minor materials.
  3. Total figures are based on raw data and therefore may not sum due to rounding.
  4.  The level of material footprint for the Eurostat approach is shown excluding imports and exports of precious metals. Precious metals (particularly gold) have a high RME factor, so can have distinctive impact on the results. This is particularly true for the UK, who are responsible for more than three quarters of the EU’s imports of gold. While the impact is minimal at the total level, it is more evident when looking at the material footprint of metal ores.

other_info: The choice of method used to calculate material footprint has an impact on the final estimates. In 2017, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulted extensively with the University of Leeds about developing further environmentally relevant metrics for material use and resource efficiency, particularly in carbon terms. As a result, the University of Leeds have developed a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) approach, using a specifically derived UK MRIO database to underpin calculations. These estimates and further information on the Eurostat and University of Leeds approach are published in the <a href= "https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/measuringmaterialfootprintintheuk2008to2016">Measuring material footprint</a> report. While data is available from 2000, it is not reported here because data from 2008 onwards are not directly comparable to those in earlier years. In addition, the Eurostat method is more suitable for international comparisons. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
