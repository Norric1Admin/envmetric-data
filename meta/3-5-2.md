data_footnote: >-
  Energy intensity is calculated by dividing reallocated energy consumption by Gross Value Added (GVA) in constant prices. This is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given industry. This means the difference between the value of goods and services produced
  (output) and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used up in production (intermediate consumption). Data are in constant prices with 2016 defined as the base year.
graph_type: line
graph_title: Energy intensity in terms of reallocated energy use and gross value added
indicator_number: 3.5.2
indicator_definition: Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific
  development agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates
  of poverty consistent with the country’s specific economic and social circumstances,
  and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.
