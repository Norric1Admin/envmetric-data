  The Water Exploitation Index (WEI) presented here shows the annual total fresh water abstraction in a country as a percentage of its long term annual average available water from renewable fresh water resources. This includes water removed from any fresh water source, either permanently
  or temporarily, as well as mine and drainage water and water abstractions from precipitation. Water used for hydroelectricity generation (in situ use) is excluded.

We have used the 'water exploitation index' an approximation of this metric.

This includes: i) the annual total fresh water abstraction in a country as a percentage of its long-term annual average (LTAA) available water from renewable fresh water resources; ii) the annual groundwater abstraction as a percentage of the country’s long-term annual average groundwater available for abstraction; and iii) the annual surface water abstraction as a percentage of the country’s long-term annual average surface water resources available for abstraction.

Total fresh water abstraction includes water removed from any fresh water source, either permanently or temporarily. Mine water and drainage water as well as water abstractions from precipitation are included, whereas water used for hydroelectricity generation (in situ use) is excluded.
