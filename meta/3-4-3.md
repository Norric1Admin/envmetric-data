computation_definitions: Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking is the proportion of total population primarily using clean cooking fuels and technologies for cooking. Under WHO guidelines, kerosene is excluded from clean cooking fuels.
  The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources. Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from hydroelectric power, wind, wave, tidal, solar photovoltaic, geothermal
  aquifers, landfill gas, sewage gas, biogas from autogen, municipal solid waste, poultry litter, straw, wood, charcoal, liquid bio-fuels, bioethanol, biodiesel and biomass.
Passenger and freight volumes are the sum of the passenger and freight volumes reported for the air carriers in terms of number of people and metric tonnes of cargo respectively.

#### In the UK there are two measures of renewable energy consumption, an Environmental Accounts figure produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and a Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) figure produced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).

### The data presented below are based on the Environmental Accounts figures. For more information about the two sources, please see the Other Information section of the National Metadata at the bottom of this page.
