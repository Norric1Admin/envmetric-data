We have therefore identified relevant policy/legislation by country, as well as the official curriculum and some supporting case studies.\n\n*England*\n\n[English National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum)\nThere is no statutory requirement for Sustainable Development Education in the National Curriculum in England. However, Sustainable Development education forms part of a range of subjects in the National Curriculum. There are also a number of government funded programmes that schools and pupils can choose to participate in to enhance their learning of sustainable development.\n\n*Northern Ireland*\n\n[Overview of the Northern Ireland Curriculum](http://ccea.org.uk/curriculum/overview)\n[Education For Sustainable Development](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2007/46/introduction/made) is part of the required minimum content for Key Stage 3. \n\n*Scotland*\n\n[Scottish Curriculum for Excellence](http://www.gov.scot/resource/doc/226155/0061245.pdf) and [Learning for Sustainability (DOC 33 KB)](http://www.gov.scot/resource/0041/00416172.docx)\n[Learning for Sustainability](https://education.gov.scot/education-scotland/scottish-education-system/policy-for-scottish-education/policy-drivers/learning-for-sustainability) is a cross-curricular approach, that weaves together global citizenship, sustainable development education and outdoor learning.\n\n*Wales*\n\n[Welsh Curriculum](http://learning.gov.wales/resources/improvementareas/curriculum/?lang=en), [Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2015/2/contents/enacted) (see Goal 4 in particular) and [Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship](http://learning.gov.wales/resources/browse-all/education-for-sustainable-development-and-global-citizenship/?lang=en)\n\n[Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship](https://hwb.gov.wales/storage/eaf467e6-30fe-45c9-93ef-cb30f31f1c90/common-understanding-for-school.pdf) provides learners, at all stages of education, an understanding of the broad themes of Sustainable Development.\n\nA support document showing relevant ESD case studies can be found in [\u2018Good practice in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in the UK - Case Studies\u2019 (PDF 165 KB)](https://www.unesco.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/UKNC-Case-Study-1-FINAL.pdf).\n","indicator":"5.3.2"}
