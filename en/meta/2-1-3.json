The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [\u03bcg/m3 ]. Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases. Urban/rural data - while the data quality available for urban/rural population is generally good for high income countries, it can be relatively poor for some low- and middle income areas. Furthermore, the definition of urban/rural may greatly vary by country.","computation_calculations":"The annual urban mean concentration of PM2.5 is estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016a; Shaddick et al, 2016).","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Health Organisation (WHO)","source_periodicity_1":"Discontinuous","source_earliest_available_1":2008,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.AMBIENTCITY2016?lang=en","source_url_text_1":"Global Health Observatory data repository","source_release_date_1":"15/05/2014","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-Official","source_contact_1":"WHO Regional Office for Europe","source_other_info_1":"Values >2013 not available - see Data Source 2","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"World Health Organisation (WHO)","source_periodicity_2":"Discontinuous","source_earliest_available_2":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"United Kingdom","source_url_2":"http://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/","source_url_text_2":"WHO Global Ambient Air Quality Database (update 2018)","source_release_date_2":"01/05/2018","source_next_release_2":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_2":"Non-Official","source_contact_2":"http://www.who.int/about/contacthq/en/","source_other_info_2":"Ambient (outdoor) air quality database, by country and city","indicator_name":"Concentrations of other (non-climate-forcing) pollutants","indicator_sort_order":"02-01-03","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":"2","target_name":"Atmospheric pollution","target_id":"2.1","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank (WB)","un_designated_tier":"1","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-09-28: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Norric1Admin/envmetric-data/commit/5c0374fc129b365db29c5ef5e27c9d8975ba50ca","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-09-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Norric1Admin/envmetric-data/commit/9858afe63c9650c052439c65f5a9301aad449c79","page_content":"This metric is related to the [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://norric1admin.github.io/envmetric-site/climate-sdgs/).\n","indicator":"2.1.3"}
