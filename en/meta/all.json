Missing - The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence.

Indirectly affected - People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and psychological consequences.

For 2019, the data cut-off is 31 May. The boundary between protected areas on-land and at-sea is mean high water (mean high water spring in Scotland).  Coastal sites in the indicator are split between \u2018on-land\u2019 and \u2018at-sea\u2019 if they cross the mean high water mark.  At-sea extent includes offshore marine protected areas out to the limit of the UK continental shelf. Extent is based on the following site designations - Areas of Special Scientific Interest, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, National Nature Reserves, Marine Conservation Zones, Nature Conservation Marine Protected Areas, Ramsar Sites, Special Areas of Conservation (including candidate Special Areas of Conservation and Sites of Community Importance), Special Protection Areas, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Scenic Areas, National Parks. Many protected areas in the UK cover the same physical parcels of land, but for different reasons; as a result the designation types can overlap.  For example, it is possible for an individual site to be designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Special Area of Conservation (SAC), Special Protection Area (SPA), Ramsar site and National Nature Reserve (NNR), and could also be part of a National Park, an AONB (Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty) or National Scenic Area (NSA).","computation_calculations":"Total extent of protected areas at-sea is calculated using a program written by JNCC which uses a number of site designation files as input, and calculates a set of non-overlapping polygons for that entire set of designations for each year.  This has allowed the basis of the indicator to be expanded over time (including more site types), and allows comparisons to be made between inclusion and exclusion of wider landscape designations. The program also splits the areas calculated into terrestrial, inshore (within 12 nautical miles of the coast), and offshore (beyond 12NM out to the edge of the UK Continental shelf).  Inshore and offshore extent are combined in the measure \u2018Total extent of protected areas at-sea\u2019.

The purpose of the Water Framework Directive is to establish a framework for the protection of inland surface waters, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwater. The framework for delivering the Directive is through River Basin Management Planning. The UK has been split into several River Basin Districts. Each River Basin District has been characterised into smaller management units known as Water Bodies. The surface Water Bodies may be rivers, lakes, estuary or coastal. Surface water status is measured by both its ecological and chemical status. It is assessed against the scale of high, good, moderate, poor and bad. The results published each year relate to data reported in that year under the Water Framework Directive.","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (GEMS/Water)","indicator_name":"Water ecosystem condition","indicator_sort_order":"04-03-01","published":true,"national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","computation_definitions":"Figures are based on numbers of surface water bodies classified under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Includes rivers, canals (Northern Ireland does not report on canals), lakes, estuaries and coastal water bodies. Surface water status is measured by both its ecological and chemical status. It is assessed against the scale of high, good, moderate, poor and bad. The ecological status of surface waters is assessed according to the following criteria - Biological quality (measured by composition and abundance of specified elements such as fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic flora); Hydromorphological quality (measured by reference to elements such as river continuity, channel patterns, dynamics of flow or substrate of the river bed); and Physico-chemical quality (measured by reference to elements such as temperature, oxygenation, pH, nutrient conditions and the concentrations of specific pollutants [synthetic and non-synthetic]). The chemical status of surface waters is assessed according to the following criteria - Chemical quality (measured by reference to environmental quality standards for chemical substances at European level). These standards specify maximum annual average concentrations for specific water pollutants. The specific requirements differ depending on which type of surface water body is being monitored. Chemical status is measured as either good or fail. If part of a water body fails on any one of the criteria monitored, it will fail to achieve or lose good status. This is described as the \"one out all out\" approach. The results published each year relate to data reported in that year under the WFD; data reported in a given year relate to data collected over the previous year (for Scotland) and previous 3 years (for England, Wales and Northern Ireland).","computation_calculations":"The percentage of water bodies in each status class has been calculated based on the total number of water bodies assessed in each year.

The introduction of new Water Framework Directive (WFD) monitoring data and classification standards (including a new baseline adopting all of the new standards, tools, designations and water body boundaries) in 2014 has led to a step change in the number of water bodies assessed as being in each status class in following years. The formal reporting of new standards in cycle 2 of WFD has used the second cycle plans published in 2015.  The introduction of reporting the cycle 2 standards has differed amongst the UK countries. The percentage of water bodies in each status class has been calculated based on the total number of water bodies assessed in each year. The number of water body assessments included varies slightly from year to year. The reductions in the number of assessments made in 2015 and 2016 were primarily due to Wales and then England adopting the monitoring and classification standards laid down in Cycle 2 of the WFD. This resulted in the removal of a number of water bodies that were below the 10km2 catchment area in line with WFD guidance.

Indirectly affected - People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and psychological consequences.

The DUKES statistics are used to monitor the UK\u2019s progress against the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The ONS National Accounts statistics are compliant with the definitions of the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting. The ONS statistic is calculated on a residency basis, whereas the DUKES figure is calculated on a territory basis. This means the ONS statistic uses data relating to UK residents and UK-registered businesses, regardless of whether they are based in the UK or overseas. This makes the ONS statistic comparable to other National Account statistics, for example, GDP, as well as other SDG indicators, for example, 7.3.1 Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP. For this reason, the ONS figures have been displayed here. The [DUKES publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digest-of-uk-energy-statistics-dukes) is annually produced by BEIS. The ONS also produce a [bridging table](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsenergybridging) to aid with comparisons between the two measures.

The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [\u03bcg/m3 ]. Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases.
