Under WHO guidelines, kerosene is excluded from clean cooking fuels. The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources. Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from hydroelectric power, wind, wave, tidal, solar photovoltaic, geothermal, aquifers, landfill gas, sewage gas, biogas from autogen, municipal solid waste, poultry litter, straw, wood, charcoal, liquid bio-fuels, bioethanol, biodiesel and biomass.
